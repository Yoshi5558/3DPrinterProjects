The stock ender 3 hot end leaves a lot to be desired. It uses high rpm, needlessly thin, 12V fans that sound like a laptop having a bad day.


I hated this when I first got my printer so something needed to be done.

A fairly complex peice, that took a second to print with sufficient rigidity and wall quality, but was well worth the effort. 


I paired it with 2 Noctua 40mm x 10mm fans for part cooling and a Noctua 40mm x 20mm fan for the hot end cooling. These fans run at 5V which necessitated 
an inline buck converter which I would mount on the lower extrusion.

There are a few photos under V1UpgradedCooling Photos in this repo.
