Old and New improvements to my at home 3d printing setup


I have owned a 3D printer for a few years now, having gotten into it during Uni. I started with an ender 3 V2, and have worked on a few improvements since then. The easiest is the direct drive upgrade from creality that I got when I bought the printer. The rest are at home printed projects. This repo contains new and old improvements, whether they be CAD files or whatever.
